# Algorithm-Animator
A dynamic web application that visually animates and compares popular sorting algorithms (Bubble, Merge, Quick, etc.) in real-time. Built with Vanilla JS and featuring a modern, responsive interface.

🤖 Algorithm Animator 📊

An interactive web application designed to demystify the inner workings of common sorting algorithms through real-time visualization. Watch data bars rearrange themselves according to the rules of each algorithm, helping you understand their efficiency and complexity.

The application features a modern, high-contrast, neon-inspired theme for an engaging learning experience.

✨ Features

Five Algorithms: Visualize and compare the performance of:

Bubble Sort (🟢)

Selection Sort (🟡)

Insertion Sort (🔵)

Merge Sort (🟣)

Quick Sort (🔴)

Dynamic Arrays: Generate a new random array instantly with the click of a button.

Real-time Animation: Bars change color to indicate comparison, movement, and final sorted position, providing clear step-by-step feedback.

Responsive Design: Optimized for viewing on both desktop and mobile devices.

🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is built using foundational web technologies with no external frameworks or libraries:

HTML5: Structure and content.

CSS3: Custom styling for the modern, cyberpunk-inspired look.

Vanilla JavaScript: Core logic for array generation, sorting algorithms, and DOM manipulation for visualization.

🚀 How to Run Locally

Since this is a client-side application built purely on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, no complex build process or server environment is needed.

Clone the Repository:

git clone [your-repository-url]
cd algorithm-animator


(Replace [your-repository-url] with the actual URL)

Open the File:
Locate the index.html file in the root directory.

Launch in Browser:
Double-click index.html to open it directly in your preferred web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).

The application will load and automatically generate the first random array. You can then use the control buttons to start visualizing the sorting process.

Note: The application uses client-side JavaScript timing functions (setTimeout and Promise) to create the delay in visualization. Performance may vary slightly based on browser and system resources.
